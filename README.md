Implement **three** methods:

1) **HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> anagrams(String filename)**
   Given a **text file** containing English words, build a **hashmap** that holds lists of words that are anagrams.
2) **ArrayList<String> mostFrequentAnagram(HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> anagrams)**
   Given a **hashmap** that holds lists of words that are anagrams, return the **list that has the most words** (the list that contains the most amount of anagrams).
3) **void printKeyValuePairs(HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> anagrams)**
   Given a **hashmap** that holds lists of words that are anagrams, **output all of the key value pairs**.[Scan 25 Feb 2025 at 6.37 PM.pdf](../../Downloads/Scan%2025%20Feb%202025%20at%206.37%20PM.pdf)
